# crypto_core Agent Workflow v4.1

> Canonical, executable operating protocol for `crypto_core` inside `demircaliskan2009-pixel/BIST_ELITE_CORE`.
> Companions (durable rails, not re-pasted into prompts): `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` / `CLAUDE.local.md`,
> and `docs/crypto_core/agent_prompts/token_efficiency_v2.md` (prompt lanes). On any apparent conflict the
> **stricter safety rule wins**. This document contains **no secrets, credentials, API keys, exchange
> credentials, or live-trading instructions**, and instructs no real order flow.

## 1. Purpose

Persist one command-level, auditable workflow so every Claude / Codex / ChatGPT turn does the **maximum
safe bounded work per prompt** while preserving the crypto_core standard: **paper-first, deterministic,
fail-closed, audit-first, derivatives-first, governance-first, risk-bounded**. Active scope is
`src/crypto_core`, `tests/crypto_core`, `scripts/crypto_core`, `docs/crypto_core` only. BIST is historical
context — never implemented here.

## 2. Model Roles

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| **Claude** (Opus 4.8 local agent) | Implementation / repair / closeout **executor**. Bounded patch, full local validation, PR open/update, CI poll to terminal, same-branch repair of valid in-scope P1/P2, standard merge **only on explicit per-PR authorization**, post-merge verify. |
| **Codex** | **Adversarial P1/P2 reviewer** — hidden-bug hunting, digest/fail-closed/architecture challenge. Runs **asynchronously** in a separate step; never merges. |
| **ChatGPT** | **Live GitHub controller** — verifies head/files/checks/threads/open-PR state, classifies, and issues the next implementation / repair / merge prompt. |

Strongest reasoning (Opus xhigh) is reserved for contract/digest/fail-closed/review-blocker work;
status/polling/mechanical steps use the cheapest sufficient lane.

## 3. Hard Rules

- crypto_core only; **no BIST implementation leakage** (BIST is historical context).
- **One open PR at a time.** Verify live (`gh pr list --state open`) at the start of every task.
- **No direct push to `main`.** No force-push. No branch deletion unless the authorized command says so.
- **Standard merge only** (no squash/rebase). **No merge without explicit human authorization naming the PR and the exact command.**
- **CI `pending` / `queued` / `in_progress` / `no checks reported` is NOT_READY** — keep polling to terminal, or report a bounded-timeout snapshot. Never treat a startup window as green.
- **Codex review is asynchronous** and is a **separate gate** — an implementation/repair turn ends at terminal CI + report; it does not block waiting for review.
- Every repo-state claim must be **git/gh/test-verifiable** (never from memory). Unproven → mark `UNKNOWN`.
- **Same-branch repair only** for valid in-scope P1/P2; stop on unsafe scope expansion.
- No live/private API, real orders, order routing, scheduler, auto-loop, connector/readiness, runtime/orchestrator, or shadow/live unless **explicitly scoped and separately designed**.
- No hidden IO/env/random/wall-clock/threading/subprocess in product code unless explicitly scoped.
- No `gh pr review --approve` (self-approval) ever.
- **Digest-boundary rule (recurring P1 class):** any consumer of a digest-carrying object must recompute the upstream digest via the **public serializer** (remove the self-digest field, canonical JSON `sort_keys=True, separators=(",",":"), ensure_ascii=True, allow_nan=False`, SHA-256) and **reject mismatch before READY/ADMITTED/ACCEPTED**. A matching id is never sufficient; a forged/non-serializable upstream must hit the `*_mismatch` path, never a raw `TypeError`. Tests must include a tampered-field case.

## 4. Standard PR Lifecycle

1. ChatGPT selects one bounded slice → one Claude implementation prompt (pinned expected `main` HEAD, "open PRs: none").
2. Claude executes the **Implementation Loop** (§5) → opens one PR → polls CI to terminal → reports. No merge.
3. Codex performs adversarial P1/P2 review **asynchronously** (§8).
4. ChatGPT verifies live GitHub state and issues a repair / merge / next prompt (§9).
5. Claude runs the **Repair Loop** (§6) on the same branch if instructed.
6. Claude runs the **Closeout/Merge Loop** (§7) **only** from an explicit closeout authorization.
7. Claude runs **Post-Merge Verification** (§12) and stops. ChatGPT selects the next slice (§15).

## 5. Claude Implementation Loop

```
# precheck (read-only)
git fetch origin
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git rev-parse HEAD                         # MUST equal the prompt's expected SHA
git status --short --branch                # MUST be clean + in sync
gh pr list --repo demircaliskan2009-pixel/BIST_ELITE_CORE --state open --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,url   # MUST be []
```

Then: bounded read (named files only, no broad scan) → design → smallest additive patch (enforce
allowed-files + max-changed-files) → self-audit (scope / digest re-proof / provenance / strict-Decimal /
fail-closed / no hidden IO / paper-safety triple) → targeted tests → relevant suite → **full helper after
meaningful changes** → `git diff --check` → scoped `git add <paths>` → commit → push → `gh pr create` →
**poll CI to terminal** (§ CI rule in §3) → inspect threads that exist (§8) → report (§10). **No merge.**

## 6. Claude Repair Loop

- Precheck first (branch + `HEAD == expected SHA` + clean tree + exactly one open PR + changed files ⊆ scope).
- Pin PR number and expected head; repair **only the named blockers**, **same branch only**, bounded to named files.
- **Test-only by default**; touch production only if a **new failing test proves a real defect**, and only inside the named module. If test-only, prove `git diff <prev> HEAD -- src/` is **empty**.
- Re-validate fully (targeted → relevant suite → full helper `PYTEST_EXIT=0` → `git diff --check`) → scoped add → commit → push same branch → **re-poll CI to terminal** → report. **No merge.**

## 7. Claude Closeout / Merge Loop

Run **only** from an explicit closeout prompt that names the PR and the exact authorized command.

- Re-prove freshly (no memory): `HEAD == authorized SHA`; `state == OPEN`; `mergeable == MERGEABLE`;
  `mergeStateStatus == CLEAN`; changed files == expected set; CI terminal green/skip; exactly one open PR;
  zero unresolved valid review threads.
- Resolve **only** review threads explicitly named in the closeout prompt, and **only after** proving the
  fix exists in source at the current HEAD (line-cited). Never self-resolve otherwise.
- Merge with the exact authorized command (standard `--merge`, `--delete-branch=false`).
- **On 502/timeout/empty output: do NOT blind-retry.** Verify first:
  `gh pr view <#> --json state,mergedAt,mergeCommit,mergedBy,headRefOid` and `git rev-parse origin/main`.
  If `MERGED` → continue to §12. Else report `MERGE_TRANSIENT_NOT_MERGED` and stop.
- If the PR is **already MERGED** before the merge command (stale prompt) → no-op, verify main contains the merge commit, continue to §12.

## 8. Codex Review Protocol

- Codex runs **asynchronously** after a push; findings may not exist when Claude's turn ends. Claude inspects threads that exist at terminal CI and reports `0 threads (review may post later)` if none.
- Inspect via GraphQL: `reviewThreads(first:n){ nodes{ id isResolved isOutdated path line comments } }` + `reviews`.
- Codex emits the report in §10. ChatGPT relays valid findings (with thread IDs) as a dedicated Claude repair prompt; Claude does not wait in-turn for review.

## 9. ChatGPT Controller Gate

ChatGPT independently re-verifies live GitHub state (head SHA, files, checks `name=conclusion`, threads,
open-PR rule) before any verdict, and issues exactly one next prompt. Merge authorization must name the PR
and the exact standard-merge command. ChatGPT emits the verdict format in §10.

## 10. Required Report Formats

**Claude (every task) — fixed fields, all repo claims git/gh/test-verifiable:**
```
RESULT / PR / HEAD_SHA / BRANCH / FILES_CHANGED / COMMITS / VALIDATION / CHECKS /
REVIEW_THREADS / SCOPE_CONFIRMATION / FINAL_GIT_STATUS / BLOCKERS / NEXT_SAFE_ACTION
```
The **last** element of every Claude task message is a single self-contained, copy-paste **ChatGPT handoff
code block** (repo; PR number/state; branch/head SHA/base SHA; files changed; commits; checks; review
threads; validation commands+results; open-PR state; exact `gh`/`git` verification commands). No full logs
(failure tails only); no uncited state.

**Codex (review):**
```
VERDICT / P1_BLOCKERS / P2_BLOCKERS / NON_BLOCKING_NOTES / MERGE_READINESS / REQUIRED_REPAIRS_IF_ANY
```

**ChatGPT (controller verdict):**
```
VERDICT / PROOF / REASON / NEXT_PROMPT
```

## 11. Merge Gate

Merge only if **all** are true (each freshly proven):
HEAD == authorized SHA · PR `state == OPEN` · `headRefOid == authorized SHA` · changed files == expected
set · exactly one open PR (this one) · CI checks terminal **green or accepted skip only** (no
pending/queued/in_progress/no-checks) · zero unresolved valid review threads · working tree clean · any
test-only repair proven to have no `src/` change · no forbidden-scope surface (§16) · no protected-contract
weakening · explicit human authorization with PR + exact command. Any miss → stop with proof, do not merge.

## 12. Post-Merge Verification (exact commands)

```
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git rev-parse HEAD                                                   # == merge commit SHA
python -m ruff check  src/crypto_core tests/crypto_core scripts/crypto_core
python -m ruff format --check src/crypto_core tests/crypto_core scripts/crypto_core
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/crypto_core/run_full_tests_logged.ps1   # require PYTEST_EXIT=0
git diff --check
git status --short --branch
gh pr list --repo demircaliskan2009-pixel/BIST_ELITE_CORE --state open --json number,title,headRefName,baseRefName,url   # expect []
```
The full-suite log is UTF-16 and may not carry the `N passed` line; the authoritative success signal is
**`PYTEST_EXIT=0`**. Full crypto_core tests run **only** via `run_full_tests_logged.ps1` (never bare full
pytest); targeted runs via `scripts/crypto_core/run_logged_command.ps1`; commands one at a time; scoped
`git add` only.

## 13. Stop Conditions (hard — stop with proof, no mutation)

Wrong repo · non-crypto_core scope · unexpected PR/head (HEAD ≠ expected SHA) · more than one open PR when
creating a PR · dirty overlapping files not owned by the task · requested repair outside allowed files ·
live/private/order/scheduler/connector/runtime/shadow/live leakage · hidden IO/env/random/subprocess not
scoped · failing required validation / full helper · unresolved valid review thread at the merge gate ·
pending CI at the merge gate · direct main push · force push · self-approval · merge without exact human
authorization · external/current fact required (→ `DEEP_RESEARCH_REQUIRED`).

## 14. Warning-Not-Stop Conditions (proceed, but note)

Transient `gh`/API 502/timeout (verify state once, continue) · CI `no checks reported` immediately after
push (startup window — keep polling) · `gh pr checks` non-zero exit while checks pending (not a failure) ·
`mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` solely from unresolved threads on an otherwise green PR (expected pre-merge) ·
ruff auto-reformat of your own new files / `F401` (format-then-check, continue) · unrelated dirty files not
owned by the task (do not stage/revert; report and scope around) · UTF-16 full-suite log (rely on
`PYTEST_EXIT`).

## 15. Next-Slice Selection Rule

ChatGPT selects exactly one bounded slice that maximizes edge-to-money product value along the chain
`StrategySpec → LBR → PIT/DataRequirement → DecisionLedger → EvidenceStore → BacktestAdmission → Replay →
PaperSleeve → Promotion → Allocator → ExecutionSim`, with: one coherent theme · bounded named files ·
independent-safe · testable · current repo/PR state proven · no hard-gate violation · paper-first (no
live/order/scheduler stage). Prefer the smallest additive change that unlocks the next bridge; one open PR
only.

## 16. Forbidden Scope

Forbidden unless explicitly authorized and separately designed: live/private API; credentials/secrets/API
keys; real orders; order routing; scheduler; auto-loop; connector/readiness; runtime/orchestrator;
shadow/live execution; fills; PnL; positions; venue/order-id surface; persistence/file/network/env IO added
to product code; backtest/replay engine unless that is the objective; EvidenceStore/persistence unless that
is the objective; **any BIST behavior**. This document and any future prompt must never include account
tokens, credentials, exchange keys, private local machine configuration, or live-trading/real-order
instructions.

*v4.1 (2026-06-15): rewrote the model-role model to the current three-role protocol — Claude =
implementation/repair/closeout executor, Codex = asynchronous adversarial P1/P2 reviewer, ChatGPT = live
GitHub controller. Preserved the durable digest-boundary rule, validation policy (`run_full_tests_logged.ps1`),
and state-claim policy. Companion prompt lanes remain in `docs/crypto_core/agent_prompts/token_efficiency_v2.md`.*
